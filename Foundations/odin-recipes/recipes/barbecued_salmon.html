                <h3>Steps</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>For the marinade, place all the ingredients in a small saucepan over medium heat and stir until sugar has dissolved. Transfer to a bowl and chill until cooled completely. Add salmon to the bowl, toss to combine and cover with plastic wrap. Chill for 3-4 hours, to marinate, turning occasionally, or if time permits, overnight.</li>
                    <li>Meanwhile, for the lime dressing, place all the ingredients in a small jar with a lid. Season to taste and shake well to combine. Set aside. You can adjust your balance of flavours with sweet, sour and salty, according to your preference.</li>
                    <li>Heat a large non-stick frypan over high heat. Add the oil and butter and when butter begins to foam, drain salmon well from the marinade then place in the frypan, skin-side up. Cook for 2-3 minutes until caramelised and deep golden. Turn and cook for a further 1-2 minutes until caramelised. Remove from the heat and rest salmon in pan for 5-6 minutes before serving.</li>
                    <li>To make the salad, place all remaining ingredients in a large bowl, add half of the dressing, season to taste and toss to combine.</li>
                    <li>Divide salad among plates and top with the salmon. Serve scattered with extra chilli and lime halves, alongside.</li>
