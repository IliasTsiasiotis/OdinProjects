                <h3>Steps</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Place oil in a large heavy-based saucepan over high heat. Sear pork, turning, for 5-6 minutes until all sides are lightly golden and skin is slightly blistered.</li>
                    <li>Combine sake, soy, mirin, sugar, ginger and 4 cups (1L) water in a large jug. Pour over pork belly and bring to a simmer. Skim off any impurities that rise to the surface. Reduce heat to low, cover with a lid and simmer for 1 hour 15 minutes-1 hour 30 minutes, until pork is tender, but not falling apart. Remove from heat and cool to room temperature. Chill overnight to allow flavours to develop.</li>
                    <li>Meanwhile, bring a small saucepan of water to the boil. Add eggs and cook for 6 1/2 minutes. Drain and refresh in iced water. Peel eggs and place in cooking liquid with the pork to marinate overnight.</li>
                    <li>The following day, remove eggs and set aside. Place pan over medium heat and bring to a gentle simmer. Simmer for 20-25 minutes until pork is warmed through. Remove pork from braising liquid and thinly slice. Place on a serving platter and pour over braising liquid. Top with halved eggs. To eat, place a slice of pork on a lettuce leaf and top with desired condiments and egg, and roll up to eat.</li>
